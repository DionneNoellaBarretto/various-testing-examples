# Test types

## Intro

- Recap: You get the basics of testing, we focused a single function
- Functions tests are ubiquotos - this technique works whenever your code lies
- I know what you need next! 🤑
- Another approach: test the things that the user can do

## UI testing

- Show the UI - assume that we have this UI 🖼
- How do we test it manually? click, click
- Show the test - do the same in code
- Render - Need fixture, this is not browser, it's like production ‍👯‍
- Simulate - User like
- Assertion - In UI there's no response...

## API testing

- Backend testing intro - We can test functions, middlewares, DB
- API testing is special - (a) Catch anything, any bug (b) Check the requirements
- Arrange - Very similar to function call, we have input/output
- Act - Any http client
- Assert - ...
- Value again - Easy, comprehensive
- Price in the before-all - 
- Bottom-line: Great tests, challenging setup, but once
- Follow-up: which tests are better: unit vs integration
